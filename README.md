# Mom's Recipe Book

This is a web app that acts as a recipe book. A database is used to store information about dishes. Users can create new dishes, update dishes, delete dishes, or search for dishes.

## Motivation

My main motivation for creating this web app was to learn a tech stack. The tech stack I chose to learn was the MERN stack (MySQL, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). I chose to create a CRUD app as my first project because it's simplicity allowed me to learn how make basic requests and database queries. This project was based off of one of my first programming projects, the "Recipe Randomizer" built using C++. Since that project was created for my mom, I decided it would be neat to build her an upgraded version.

## Features

- Create and add new dishes to the database.
- Show all dishes currently in the database.
- Search for specific dishes (can search using prefixes, i.e. searching "steamed" will show "steamed chicken" and "steamed broccoli").
- Update information of an existing dish.
- Delete an exisiting dish from the database.
- Filter shown dishes by category.
